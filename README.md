# Project Name

### Personal-Portfolio

# Project Description

The sole purpose of this project is for me to have a personal portfolio. In this portfolio I am able to give a brief explanation of who I am, what I like, what are my skills, and I am also able to show some of my previos works and projects. Through this portfolio I am also able to demostrate my abilities, since it can be seen that the page does have transitions, and it is also responsive.

# Technologies

## List of Technologies used

- React
- HTML
- CSS

## Why these technologies?

I chose these technologies since this is are the technologies I am learning right now in college, and I also thinkg these were the best options for a visually appealing portfolio.
